        <h5>
          Are you ready to start eating insanely delicious Vietnamese food when
          you’re in Saigon?
        </h5>
        <h4>1. Bánh mì (banh mi)</h4>
        <div id="banhmi">
          <div class="textOnImg">
            <p class="indentText">
              If you’re even the slightest bit into Vietnamese food, you’ve
              probably eaten numerous banh mi sandwiches.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              Along with pho, easily the most exported Vietnamese speciality is
              banh mi. Although banh mi can mean a variety of different things,
              and in Vietnamese it actually just means bread, sometimes the term
              can be used to refer to any type of the beautiful Vietnamese
              personal baguette sandwich.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              Walking around Saigon you’ll see dozens of carts with signs
              selling banh mi – it’s actually hard to go more than a block
              without seeing one – so it’s never hard to find.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              There are many different varieties of banh mi, and here’s a good
              resource for seeing the different types, but the basic sandwich
              starts with a crusty baguette that’s sliced in half (sometimes
              using a scissors) and stuffed with layers of pork, luncheon meats,
              shredded cured pork skin, pâté, mayonnaise, Vietnamese radish and
              carrot pickles, a handful of sliced cucumbers, sprigs of coriander
              (cilantro), and last but not least, an optional, yet in my opinion
              necessary, scoop of fresh pounded chilies.
            </p>
            <p class="indnetText">
              The sum of these ingredients together is what really makes banh mi
              such a glorious sandwich. Coming from Bangkok, where I can’t
              remember the last time I ate bread or a sandwich for that matter,
              I was pretty happy to devour as many banh mi as I could when I was
              in Vietnam.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>2. Ốp la (op la)</h4>
        <div id="opla">
          <div class="textOnImg">
            <p class="indentText">
              A beautiful alternative to the banh mi sandwich is a Vietnamese
              dish called op la, or eggs cooked in a littler personal pan, often
              supplemented by slices of meat like ham, onions, and served with
              those wonderful crusty Vietnamese baguettes.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              Just like some other dishes on this blog, op la offers a bit of a
              fusion of Vietnamese and Western ingredients and cooking methods,
              all blended into a single meal.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              Although there are many variations of op la, to me what really
              makes it good is if the eggs are sunny side up, so the yolk is
              extra runny, and what makes it even better is if it’s served
              topped with caramelized onions and peppers.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              Banh mi op la makes a favorite breakfast for many locals in
              Saigon, and it most definitely hits the spot before a long day
              exploring the city.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>3. Phở (pho)</h4>
        <div id="pho">
          <div class="textOnImg">
            <p class="indentText">
              No matter if you’ve been to Vietnam before or not, you’ve likely
              heard of pho, if not already eaten it many times before.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              The noodle soup didn’t become so famous for nothing – it really is
              one of the most common dishes in throughout the country, and it
              makes the Vietnamese food menu at nearly every sit-down restaurant
              too.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              Pho is the combination of soft rice noodles in a soup broth,
              normally prepared with either bo (beef) or ga (chicken) – both of
              which can be extremely delicious, but I’m normally more of a beef
              kind of guy.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              The noodles are flash boiled until soft, topped with your choice
              of meat, and often finished with a sprinkle of chopped green
              onions and sometimes sweet onions as well.
            </p>

            <p class="indentText">
              But what I really love most about eating pho in Vietnam is the
              fresh plate of herbs, typically including sawtooth herb, mint, and
              Vietnamese coriander, along with house-made chili sauce, that’s on
              your table for self-service when you eat it.
