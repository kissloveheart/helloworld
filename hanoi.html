        <h4>5 Things To Do In Hanoi</h4>
        <p class="indentText">
          Hanoi is the capital of Vietnam and is the country’s second-largest
          city. If visiting Hanoi, I highly recommend you stay in Hanoi’s Old
          Quarter. The Old Quarter is at the heart of the city and is made of
          numerous narrow streets arranged by the products sold. The
          French-influenced buildings are brightly colored, tall and skinny, and
          are typically no more than 3 meters wide.
        </p>

        <p class="indentText">
          There are a ton of things to do in Hanoi to keep you busy for a few
          days and of course, it is a great place to leave for an overnight stay
          on a Vietnamese junk boat to see stunning Halong Bay as well as other
          great North Vietnam destinations like Sapa and Ninh Binh.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>1. EXPLORE THE COLOURFUL SHOPS OF THE OLD QUARTER</h4>
          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p class="indentText">
              When you first arrive in the Old Quarter I highly recommend you
              just get out there and explore the narrow streets, experiencing
              the culture and the local way of life. It’s quite surreal how
              disordered and messy the streets are, yet how calm and friendly
              the locals tend to be. </p>
              <p class="indentText">
                As soon as you step foot onto the streets there’s no doubt that
                the Old Quarter is full of life albeit a little chaotic, but this
                is what makes Hanoi so intriguing. You will be bombarded with the
                sounds of the traffic, motorbikes, and cars continually beeping
                their horns, you will be scared to cross the main roads which will
                take you more than one attempt. The pavements are full of vendors
                selling their wares as well as colorful fruits and vegetables that
                fill the little stalls that spill onto the pavements. The Old
                Quarter is absolute chaos, but completely mesmerizing, and an
                experience that you will never forget.
              </p>
              <p class="indentText">
                Once you come slightly accustomed to the chaos one of the first
                things you will notice is how each street sells only one product.
                For example, there is paper street (selling gift wrap and cards),
                spice street, toy Street and cooking utensils street just to name
                a few.
              </p>
              <p class="indentText">
                Once you get tired of all that walking, or the traffic gets a bit
                much, and your adrenaline rush of trying to cross the main roads
                has crashed, jump on board one of the many cyclos in the town. Be
                sure to agree on the price before you get in the cyclo otherwise
                you may end up paying more than required. A ride on a cyclo
                amongst the traffic will also open your eyes to the lack of
                traffic rules on these Vietnamese roads, from entire families of 4
                plus people with no helmets on one moped to crates of live
                chickens or pigs on the back of another- certainly an eye-opener
                that’s for sure.

            <img src="/Image/hanoiFood.jpg" alt="Food HaNoi" class="imgArt">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p class="indentText">The best way to get accustomed to Vietnamese food as well as becoming familiar with the Old Quarter is to join a Vietnamese food tour for only $20. Many of the tour guides will provide you with a background on all the food, how it’s prepared, and answer your questions about Hanoi at the same time, and each stop offers something new with all the food tasting fantastic.</p>

            <p class="indentText">What is great about doing a food tour in Hanoi, apart from the food, of course, is that there is usually quite a bit of walking between places.  This gives you an opportunity not only to see more of the Old Quarter but to help digest some of the food you eat.  You will love strolling through hidden alleyways and fresh produce markets – I would have never have found these places on my own.</p> </div>

          <h4>3. CHECK OUT HANOI WITH HANOIKIDS</h4>
          <div class="col">
            <p class="indentText">
              HanoiKids is an organization that arranges young Vietnamese people to guide tourists around Hanoi to practice their English. The tours can be whatever you want them to be as they are customized to your needs. The tours are also completely free, you are only required to pay any entrance fees, transport, and food for both yourself and your guides.
            </p>
            <p class="indentText">
              I think the most amazing part was how friendly, welcoming and enthusiastic they were and to my surprise didn’t want to accept any money from us. We had two lovely young guides, who took us to the Hoa Lo Prison Museum, Museum of Ethnology, a walk around Hoan Kiem Lake and some delicious Vietnamese food. This tour was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. For a more personal tour of Hanoi, I highly recommend you take a tour with HanoiKids.

          <h4>4. GET A MASSAGE</h4>
          <div class="col">
            <p class="indentText">
              There is a massage parlor every few meters in Hanoi, or so it seems at least! So be sure to treat yourself a foot massage after all that walking. Of course, there is a whole array of treatments on offer including full-body massages, pedicures, manicures, and facials. Why not try them all! You are on holiday after all and all the treatments are relatively cheap, so it would be rude not to contribute to this tourist past time – Go on pamper yourself!

          <h4>5. VISIT THE RAILWAY VILLAGE</h4>
          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p class="indentText">
              An interesting area of Hanoi to visit is the village often referred to as the “Railway Village” or sometimes “train street”. Basically, this is a small village that is built within meters around an operational railway line. In some parts, the distance between the houses and the track is only 3-5m.
        </p>
           <p class="indentText">
            When the train leaves Hanoi going towards the south, it passes through this village, twice per day. The train is a familiar image to the people living here so they don’t think it’s dangerous since they have become used to this way of life. So, locals understandably know when the train is due and ensure all their belonging and children are safely tucked inside before the train passes by.
           </p>
           <p class="indentText">
            It is interesting to see the locals go about their day to day life with the railway line only meters from their homes.
