        <h4>All Things Need To Know Before Travelling To Hue</h4>
        <p class="indentText">
          Set between Quang Tri province to the northwest and Da Nang as well as
          Hoi An to the southwest, Hue Old Imperial capital attributes on the
          pretty itinerary every first time visitor to Vietnam. Straddling the
          genuinely beautiful Huong River, the city had the foundation at the
          18th through 19th century. It was the set of power for the Nguyen
          lords.
        </p>
        <ol class="col">
          <h4><li>Why Hue Is Special?</li></h4>
          <p class="indentText">
            Factually, it had remained the national capital until 1945, when the
            Emperor Bao Dai resigned as the country was chopped into two.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            Throughout American War, Hue’s location approximately half way
            between Hanoi from the northwest (540km) and Saigon in the south
            (644km). And it is about 15 kilometre west of the East Sea and north
            of the Demilitarised Zone in Quang Tri heavy fighting. Because it
            was the Old Capital of the last dynasty in Vietnam, Hue is the home
            of mausoleum complex of Kings.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            The tombs themselves observed little harm, however, throughout Tet
            offensive in 1968 severely damaged the Citadel and the Forbidden
            Purple City. Hue history has earned it a reputation as a political,
            religious and cultural center. In contrast, visitors to this modern
            Hue city will locate a town which only reflects its own past, and
            only does this as a begrudging nod to its visitors today.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            Much like Ha Long Bay in the north, a complex of graves, pagodas and
            palaces across Hue and its surrounds has been designated a UNESCO
            World Heritage Site. However, passing time by hundreds of years of
            war and battle, these tradition architectures are mostly destroyed
            much compared with its origin. However, thanks to the development of
            tourism has lead to reservation these traditions and revive them
            alive.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            Consequently, the tourism has developed and created much chances for
            travellers to discover many values from this old architectures and
            Royal Family.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            At this moment, Hue is a traveller destination largely. In practice,
            it is still a work in progress. Obviously, it is a beautiful and
            vibrant city, with places to stay, tasty food and quite a few
            intriguing things to do. And also it is the well-worn tourist path
            of historic attractions.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            In addition, set on the banks of the Perfume River, it is as a
            highlight to any trip to Hue city as well as in Vietnam. Beginning
            from the northeast and going to the southeast of the city, the river
            flows between and divides the city into two parts. A combination of
            man made canals and natural tributaries makes it an aqueous place
            throughout the typhoon season. This is the special for drawing water
            from monsoon season by handmade.
          </p>
          <h4>
            <li>When Is The Best To Visit Hue City?</li>
          </h4>
          <p class="indentText">
            Monsoon season is the time when the river might overflow making
            streets that are many practically impossible. Considering this, it’s
            essential for you to travel to Hue in the right season. It’s got a
            tropics monsoon climate and the dry season begins from March and
            extends to August. The temperature remains between 35 and 40 degrees
            Celsius and it is so hot.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            While the flood season usually falls after October until mid
            November and sometimes at the end of month. However, if you travel
            on flood time, it seems no much affect because most of mausoleums is
            in south of city and no affect by flood. Only The Citadel and Thien
            Mu Pagoda in north of city cannot visit if the water level is high.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            Yes, visitor can visit Hue all year round. For autumn season from
            August to mid October it is cool and nice for visiting. It is hot
            from April to September it is idea for combine visiting complex of
            monuments and tombs with relax on nice sandy beach Thuan An or Lang
            Co.
          </p>
          <p class="indentText">
            Only flood time within 1 month from mid-Oct to mid-November can
            affect your trip, but this depends each year. not always have big
            flood to affect.
